# SEO Crawler

A practical, production-minded SEO crawler that audits a website and exports page-level metadata to CSV and JSON.  
It demonstrates end-to-end problem solving across crawling, parsing, heuristics, scoring, and reporting.

## Highlights (for employers)

- **Purpose-built CLI tool** with clean packaging (`pyproject.toml`) and `src/` layout.
- **Robust parsing** via BeautifulSoup + lxml; **URL normalization** and duplicate avoidance.
- **Heuristic analysis** for low-value pages and a **0â€“100 SEO score** per URL.
- **Structured outputs** (CSV + JSON) ready for BI tools or data notebooks.
- **Tested + Linted**: lightweight unit test, `ruff` + `black` config via `Makefile`.
